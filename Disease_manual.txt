Manual For Running the Disease Code on a MAC

open a terminal on your computer

ssh into the computer which you will use which a command like

ssh physics@172.20.21.152 [username@url_name]    

password: quantum

Computers you will use are:
name        url_name
Maxwell     172.20.21.152   (in the electronics lab)
argon       172.20.21.104   (in the general physics lab)
Rutherford  sg0152cwbh.king.edu   (in the general physics lab)
Oakridge    josephftsanakis.king.edu   (in the general physics lab)
Feynman     172.20.21.149   (in the general physics lab)
Einstein    172.20.22.177   (in the general physics lab)

change into the directory object_code_1.0 with the command

cd Documents/cwfay_research/Object_code_1.0/

the command "ls" will display the contents of the directory,

run the Disease code with

./Disease (number of vertices) (connectivity) (probabilty of starting sick) (contagiousness of disease) (probability of dying) (probabilty of starting immune) (disease lifetime)

[Similar to:  ./Disease 10000 2 0.001 0.30 0.2 0.0 10]

output goes into  
This is a .csv file that can be opened in Excel or another graphing program (probably mathematica)

After each run it should be renamed. 
Usually in the format

D_(number of vertices)_(connectivity)_(probabilty of starting sick)_(contagiousness of disease)_(probability of dying)_(probabilty of starting immune)_(disease lifetime).csv

I remove all decimal places so that the command above I would move to the file

D_10k_2_0001_03_02_0_10.csv

[Either rename in file browser or by terminal command  mv Disease_Conv.csv D_10k_2_0001_03_02_0_10.csv  ]

To run the program where the person has a chance of becoming immune after the sickness,
./Disease -I 10000 2 0.001 0.30 0.2 0.0 10
-I is a switch that turns on immunity if the ill person does not die.
